        <p class="p_blog">Just like graphic design and web development, UX design trends come and go for a reason. UX is 
            all about developing a better digital world for humanity. It’s a field that requires innovation, but 
            that is constantly evolving. Regularly following UX design blogs can help you keep on top of 
            changes in the industry, as well as develop your UX skills.
            
            Additionally, many UX design blogs expose you to case studies detailing an app or web’s 
            successful development, along with how its usability was improved. Reading about these types of 
            cases can help give you ideas. In this sense, UX design blogs can help provide an indication for the 
            kinds of directions your future projects should take.
